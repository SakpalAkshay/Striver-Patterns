# Striver-Patterns


### Key Pointers

1. For python we won't be utilizing the **"*"** operator that multiplies the string, instead we would be using nested loops, which are just one level of nestedness, that one outerloop and one innerloop.
2. For **outer loop**, we would count the **number of lines** required to print, or we can say the **number of rows**.
3. The **inner loop** will focus on the **columns** & our goal would be to somehow connect it with the number of **rows**.
4. Anything required to print let say * or 123 etc will **get printed in the inner loop**.
5. For complex repetitive pattern, we need to **observe symmetry** (optional).
